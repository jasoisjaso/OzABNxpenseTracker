        <h1>Tax Deduction Guide for Australian Crafters & Laser Cutters</h1>
        <p>A guide for sole traders on common business expenses you may be able to claim. Ticking the "Tax Deductible" box for an expense helps you track potential deductions for your tax return.</p>

        <div class="disclaimer">
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a general guide only and not professional tax advice. You should consult with a registered tax agent or the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for advice specific to your circumstances.
        </div>

        <h2>Core Principles of Claiming Deductions</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>For an expense to be deductible, it must meet three key rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The expense must be directly related to earning your income.</li>
                <li>If the expense is for a mix of business and private use, you can only claim the portion that is used for your business.</li>
                <li>You must have records (like receipts or invoices) to prove the expense.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What to Tick: Common Deductible Expenses</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Assets & Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Laser Cutter & Machinery:</strong> The cost of your laser cutter, 3D printer, and other machinery. Under the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/assets-and-depreciation/instant-asset-write-off-for-eligible-businesses">instant asset write-off</a> scheme (check ATO for current thresholds, e.g., $20,000), you may be able to claim the full cost in the year you buy it.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools & Equipment:</strong> Hand tools, safety gear (goggles, masks), and other equipment used in your crafting process.</li>
                <li><strong>Computers & Laptops:</strong> Devices used for design, managing your business, and marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Repairs & Maintenance:</strong> Costs to repair and maintain your equipment and tools.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Materials & Supplies (Cost of Goods Sold)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> Plywood, MDF, acrylic sheets, and other materials that form part of the final product.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumables:</strong> Adhesives, sandpaper, paint, varnish, and other supplies used in production.</li>
                <li><strong>Postage & Packaging:</strong> Boxes, bubble wrap, tape, and postage costs for sending products to customers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Operating & Running Expenses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Software Subscriptions:</strong> Design software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, LightBurn), accounting software (e.g., Xero, Rounded), and other business-related subscriptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Website Costs:</strong> Domain name registration, web hosting fees, and costs for e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, Etsy).</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing & Advertising:</strong> Costs for social media ads, market stall fees, business cards, and flyers.</li>
                <li><strong>Bank Fees:</strong> Fees charged on your business bank account.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Premiums for business insurance, such as public liability or asset protection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Work-Related Training & Education</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Courses & Workshops:</strong> Fees for courses that improve your skills and are directly related to your business, such as a new design software course or a woodworking class.</li>
                <li><strong>Books & Journals:</strong> Subscriptions to trade magazines or the cost of books related to your craft.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Home-Based Business Expenses</h3>
             <p>If you run your business from home, you may be able to claim a portion of your home running expenses. The ATO provides two main methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Rate Method:</strong> A simple way to claim a set rate per hour you work from home (check the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/home-based-business-expenses">ATO website</a> for the current rate). This covers electricity, gas, internet, and phone usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Cost Method:</strong> Claiming the actual business portion of your expenses. This requires more detailed record-keeping.</li>
                <li><strong>Occupancy Expenses:</strong> If you have a dedicated space like a workshop or studio, you might be able to claim a portion of rent, mortgage interest, and council rates. Be aware that this can have Capital Gains Tax (CGT) implications when you sell your home.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What NOT to Tick: Common Non-Deductible Expenses</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private Expenses:</strong> Any cost that is not related to your business. For example, personal use of your phone or internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Entertainment Expenses:</strong> Costs for entertaining clients are generally not deductible.</li>
                <li><strong>GST Component:</strong> If you are registered for GST, you claim the GST portion of your expenses as a credit on your Business Activity Statement (BAS), not as a deduction in your tax return. The "Amount" you enter in the app should be the GST-inclusive price, and the app calculates the GST for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Setup Costs:</strong> Some costs to set up your business structure (e.g., company registration fees) may not be immediately deductible but could be claimed over five years.</li>
            </ul>
